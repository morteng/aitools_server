# AI Tools Server (made to be used with Seth's AI Tools front-end)

This is a forked version of the [AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) project - basically the same thing with some additional API features like background removal.

### This server is designed to be used with the [Seth's AI Tools Client](https://github.com/SethRobinson/aitools_client) <-- github page that has its download and screenshots/movies ###

Or, don't use my front-end client and just use its API directly:

* Here's a [Python Jupter notebook](https://github.com/SethRobinson/aitools_server/blob/master/aitools/automatic1111_api_tester_jupyter_notebook.ipynb) showing examples of how to use the standard AUTOMATIC1111 api
* Here's a [Python Jupter notebook](https://github.com/SethRobinson/aitools_server/blob/master/aitools/aitools_extensions_api_tester_jupyter_notebook.ipynb) showing how to use the extended features available in my forked server (AI background removal, AI subject masking, etc)

**Note:**  This repository was deleted and replaced with the [AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui](github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/wiki/Install-and-Run-on-AMD-GPUs) fork Sept 19th 2022, specific missing features that I need are folded into it. Previously I had written my own custom server but that was like, too much work man

# Last update Dec 16th, 2022, latest changes:
* Versioned to 0.40
* LagacyAPI is gone!  Background removal/auto masking features folded into AUTOMATIC1111's API, should mean this forked server will be easier for me to update (also, the AI Tools client now 99% works with the vanilla AUTOMATIC1111 server which is great)
* Misc fixes and improvements, now visually shows the status of each connected server (can click it to bring up the web ui)
* Added a lot of examples to the jupyter notebooks to help anyone trying to understand the API, renamed them to be clearer 

## Installation and Running (modified from [stable-diffusion-webui](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/wiki) docs)
Make sure the required [dependencies](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/wiki/Dependencies) are met and follow the instructions available for both [NVidia](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/wiki/Install-and-Run-on-NVidia-GPUs) (recommended) and [AMD](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/wiki/Install-and-Run-on-AMD-GPUs) GPUs.


### Automatic Installation on Windows
1. Install [Python 3.10.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/), checking "Add Python to PATH"
2. Install [git](https://git-scm.com/download/win).
3. Download the aitools_server repository, for example by running `git clone https://github.com/SethRobinson/aitools_server.git`.
4. Place `model.ckpt` in the `models` directory (see [dependencies](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/wiki/Dependencies) for where to get it).
5. Run `webui-user.bat` from Windows Explorer as normal, non-administrator, user.

### Automatic Installation on Linux
1. Install the dependencies:
Note:  Requires Python 3.9+!

```bash
# Debian-based:
sudo apt install wget git python3 python3-venv
# Red Hat-based:
sudo dnf install wget git python3
# Arch-based:
sudo pacman -S wget git python3
```
2. To install in `/home/$(whoami)/aitools_server/`, run:
```bash
bash <(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SethRobinson/aitools_server/master/webui.sh)
```

## Adding a necessary file (needed for Win/linux installs)

4. Place `model.ckpt` (or better, use sd-v1.5-inpainting.ckpt) in the base aitools_server directory (see [dependencies](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/wiki/Dependencies) for where to get it).
5. Run the server from shell with:
```bash
python launch.py --listen --port 7860 --api
```

## Google Colab

Don't have a strong enough GPU or want to give it a quick test run without hassle?  No problem, use this [Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/14FT8N_MfKNBmbPi4-xlt2YvrRzK1UN8K).  (Works fine on the free tier)

## How to update an existing install of the server to the latest version

Go to its directory (probably aitools_server) in a shell or command prompt and type:

```bash
git pull
```

## Running Seth's AI Tools front-end

Verify the server works by visiting it with a browser.  You should be able to generate and paint images via the default web gradio interface. Now you're ready to use the native client.

**Note** The first time you use the server, it may appear that nothing is happening - look at the server window/shell, it's probably downloading a bunch of stuff for each new feature you use.  This only happens the first time!

* [Download the Client (Windows, ~36 MB)](https://www.rtsoft.com/files/SethsAIToolsWindows.zip) (Or get the [Unity source](https://github.com/SethRobinson/aitools_client))
    
* Unzip somewhere and run aitools_client.exe

The client should start up.  If you click "Generate", images should start being made.  By default it tries to find the server at localhost at port 7860.  If it's somewhere else, you need to click "Configure" and edit/add server info.  You can add/remove multiple servers on the fly while using the app. (all will be utilitized simultaneously by the app)

## Using multiple GPUs on the same computer

You can run multiple instances of the server from the same install.

Start one instance:

```CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python launch.py --listen --port 7860 --api```

Then from another shell start another specifying a different GPU and port:

```CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1 python launch.py --listen --port 7861 --api```

Then on the client, click Configure and edit in an add_server command for both servers.
